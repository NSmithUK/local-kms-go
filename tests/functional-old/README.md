# Functional Tests

The functional tests are being building using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

You can import [local-kms.postman_collection.json](local-kms.postman_collection.json) into your own copy of Postman.

All the tests are initially written against AWS' real KMS. The same tests must then pass against Local KMS.
